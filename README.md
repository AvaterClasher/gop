# GOP or Git Open

Gop is a simple command line tool that opens the current git repository in the browser.

Thats it. No more, no less.

## Why

I often find myself wanting to open the current git repository in the browser. I have tried a few different tools that do this, but they all seem to be a bit too much for what I want. So I decided to write my own.
